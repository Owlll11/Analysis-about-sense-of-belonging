This repo is about the project using dataset from the GSS to tell a story about data.

It is organised as follows, inputs folder includes the raw data and literature. There are no raw data contained in the data folder since there are no permission for us to share the GSS data. The raw data can be found at the website of GSS: "https://sda-artsci-utoronto-ca.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/sdaweb/html/gss.htm" and under the title "General social survey on social identity (cycle 27), 2013 (version 2)". University of Toronto UTORid is required for data downloading in GSS.
